🚗 Drift - Smart Used Car Price Prediction 💸
Drift is a dynamic web application designed to accurately predict the selling price of used cars based on key specifications. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and machine learning, Drift leverages advanced algorithms to empower users with data-driven insights, making buying and selling decisions smarter and more efficient.

📌 Features
Login & Signup: Secure user registration and authentication.
Price Prediction: Enter essential car details and get an estimated selling price within seconds.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for easy navigation and usage.
Additional Pages: Informative pages guiding users through the app and explaining the prediction model.

🔍 Machine Learning Methodology
Drift’s backend is powered by a Stacking Methodology, which enhances accuracy by combining multiple algorithms:

Base Models:
Two linear models – Linear Regression and Lasso for capturing relationships between features.
One non-linear model – Random Forest for handling more complex interactions.

Meta Model: These base models work together, stacking their predictions to generate the final output.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend
React: For dynamic UI and smooth user interactions.
HTML & CSS: Basic layout and styling.
JavaScript: For interactivity and state management.

Backend
Node.js & Express: Backend server for managing requests, user authentication, and ML model handling.
MongoDB: Database to store user data securely.
Machine Learning
Python: Machine learning models developed in Python for robust analysis and prediction.
Stacking Algorithms: Integrates Linear Regression, Lasso, and Random Forest models.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm for running the frontend and backend servers.
